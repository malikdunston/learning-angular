## Starting a Peoject
-	install cli
	npm i -g @angular/cli
-	create new app...
	ng new [name of app]
	-- you can optionally add router... or add it manually later.
-	move to directory, start dev server...
	ng serve
	-- runs on localhost:4200... opens up the default landing page...

## Files/Folders
-	config files:
	-	package.json (larger than react/vue)
		-	dependencies: core, forms, router, compiler, anims, etc...
		-	rxjs: observables/promises
		-	dev dep: jasmine, karma, etc... not as imp for now. learn later
		-	scripts
			-	build, test, lint, etc...
	-	ts.config (check to see how it watches...)
	-	angularj.son
		-	build.options.outputPath: dist/foldername by default...
			-	may want to change if making full-stack app...
		-	can add styles, cdns...
	-	src/app...
		-	all comps, etc go here.
-	src
	-	index like react
	-	main.ts == entry point to angular...
		-	import app modules. app is a module itself.
		-	can create own modules...
	-	/app

## Component Structure
-	generally a comp will have four files...
	-	ts file.. main class with props/methods, specifies template, stylesheet
	-	template: html file
	-	css files for specific comps...
	-	test files

## Making Components (Header Comp)
-	ng generate component components/header
	-	creates folders components, with header inside
	-	four files inside: css, html, ts, and .spec file...
	-	no need to import into parents like react...
	-	nesting:
		-	css: different structure than what I'm used to.
			-	ex (index.html): app-root -> app-header -> childelem
				-	you define styles on the child, inside app-header's stylesheet, not on the app-header inside app-root....
				-	probably has to do with rendering of the comps/timint...
		-	props/attrs:
			-	So... in the comp's class props...
				-	add the prop's name after @input()
				-	@input() is what "grabs" the props...
					-	@input() [propName]: [dataType]
					-	benefit over react is using the super(props) def...
				-	Have to import "Input" from @angular/core...
					-	similar to useEffect
					-	having to type @angular/thisthat... is example of how angular is powerful, yet bloated. starting to see this as I move along...
			-	"property has no initializer" error in ts...
				-	set "strictPropertyInitialization" to false in tsconfig...
					-	[from stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49699067/property-has-no-initializer-and-is-not-definitely-assigned-in-the-construc)
		-	Inline Styles
			-	format (inside html tag as attr): [ngStyle]="{'propName': value}"
				-	more complicated than react.
	-	events:
		-	syntax for event (use as attr..)
			(eventName)="functionName()"
